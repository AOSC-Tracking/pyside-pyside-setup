 - [PYSIDE-239]  Python enum types can now be used as a valid signal type.
 - [PYSIDE-571]  qApp has been turned into a normal Python variable. This
                 implies that QtWidgets.qApp no longer works; it should be
                 replaced by qApp.
 - [PYSIDE-803]  GUI slowdowns caused by background threads have been fixed
                 by reducing GIL allocation and usage of
                 Py_(BEGIN|END)_ALLOW_THREADS.
 - [PYSIDE-858]  Windows binaries are now signed.
 - [PYSIDE-939]
 - [PYSIDE-1231] Further issues introduced by Python 3.8 have been addressed:
                 - Warnings about deprecated int conversions of enumerations
                   and flags have been fixed.
                 - Packages can now be built with Python 3.8.1.
                 - Tests run with Python 3.8.1.
 - [PYSIDE-1189] A crash caused by wrong ownership of the return value of
                 QList/QTable/QTreeWidget.mimeData() has been fixed.
 - [PYSIDE-1199] The webchannel standalone example has been added.
 - [PYSIDE-1204] QByteArray now properly supports the PyBuffer interface.
 - [PYSIDE-1214] For accessors returning non-exposed classes inheriting
                 QObject, the most-derived wrapper is now created.

 - [PYSIDE-803]  The default of the "allow-thread" attribute has been changed
                 to false as it was observed to cause performance issues when
                 using threads.
 - [PYSIDE-1112] The shiboken documentation has been re-structured.
 - [PYSIDE-1228] Typedef'ed anonymous enums are now supported.
 - [PYSIDE-1240] The manual test dumpcodemodel has been modified to output
                 typesystem XML, enabling convenient generation of
                 typesystem file skeletons for new bindings.
