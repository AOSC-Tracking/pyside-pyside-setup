 - [PYSIDE-1735] The duplication of enum values into the enclosing scope,
                 allowing to write Qt.AlignLeft instead of Qt.Alignment.AlignLeft,
                 is now implemented differently and no longer advertized in PYI
                 files or line completion.
 - [PYSIDE-1735] The new Python enums are made as compatible to the old ones
                 as possible. It is again allowed to use Qt.Alignment()
                 instead of Qt.AlignmentFlag(0), and a default of 0 is
                 always allowed but also not advertized.
 - [PYSIDE-1735] Most former IntEnum/IntFlag are replaced by pure Enum/Flag
                 classes in a generally compatible way to other implementations.
 - [PYSIDE-1735] Python Enums use the newest implementation for Python (3.10)
                 for compatibility and speed.
 - [PYSIDE-1735] A weird build problem on macOS and other platforms was fixed.
 - [PYSide-1735] The cleanup calls by were sped up by using PyName for
                 staticMetaObject.
 - [PYSIDE-1930] Returning enums from QAbstractItemModel.flags() and
                 QAbstractItemModel.data() has been fixed.
 - [PYSIDE-1934] The type hinting for the return value of
                 QListWidget.selected_indexes() has been fixed.
 - [PYSIDE-1960] Initial support for Python 3.11 has been added.
 - [PYSIDE-1968] The signature of QPixmap.save() has been fixed.
 - [PYSIDE-1978] The signal
                 QAbstractItemModel.layoutAboutToBeChanged(QList<QPersistentModelIndex>)
                 has been fixed.
                 Also, the error message about using the wrong signal overload
                 has been improved.
 - [PYSIDE-2019] Crashes related to QtDataVisualization'QValue3DAxisFormatter
                 have been fixed

 - [PYSIDE-1964] The error message about mistakenly using keyword arguments
                 has been improved.
 - [PYSIDE-1988] Fixed a mistaken PySequence_Check() type check to be
                 PyTuple_Check(), which only showed in Python 3.11.
